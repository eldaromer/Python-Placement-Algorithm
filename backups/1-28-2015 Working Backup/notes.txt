Organization changes to be made in future:

- Make position tracking for bb, FGU more elegant
	- Store in one xyzr vector
	- get/set functions for x, y, z, r, xyz, xyzr vectors
	- Note that set_xyz is same as translateTo, set_r same as rotateTo, etc.
	- May want to use @property to avoid () and keep FGU and position in sync.

- Clean rotation up
	- Share rotation matrix function for bb, FGU objects

- Make rotateAbout take xyz

- Add an "autoalign" function to automatically assign gender when initializing FGU list
	- Happens when align = None, default

- Short origin2grid, grid2origin to something like f2g, g2o
	- Support fraction grid coordinates
		- Should never happen, but be robust
		- Print a warning if it does

- All of the above will simplify lots of formulate.py - use *xyz, etc.

- bb does not need to be passed - can be built from netlist (combine, then set)
